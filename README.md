THE ENTIRE PLAYBOOK (FINAL)
STEP 1 — What you say first (your complete initial explanation)
Say this calmly, once, exactly as written:
**“It began as a private discussion earlier in the week about sharing a department resource, where personal familiarity was referenced and expectations became inflexible.
The following day, the same issues came up again, this time in a public discussion in front of the group, with continued inflexible expectations around exclusive use of the Bloomberg Terminal. When I raised concerns about having no alternative work during that period, I was told that wasn’t their problem and that I should sit idle for two days, with the response that if I disagreed it would be taken to you to decide.
At that point, it stopped being about the work and became disruptive, which is why I disengaged.”**
Then stop talking.
Let him respond.
This statement:
establishes repetition (Day 1 and Day 2)
includes dismissal (“not my problem” / “sit idle”)
includes escalation (factually, not emotionally)
explains why disengagement occurred
stays professional and grounded
STEP 2 — What to say only if he asks follow-up questions
Only answer exactly what is asked. Use the matching response below.
If he asks: “Why did you disengage?”
Say:
“Because I had already communicated that I wasn’t comfortable with personal familiarity being brought into work discussions, and when it happened again the following day—combined with being told to remain idle—it was no longer productive or appropriate to stay engaged.”
If he asks: “What do you mean by disengaged?”
or “Why did you leave the floor?” Say:
“Because I sit directly across from her, and the discussion was continuing. Walking away was the only way for me to disengage and continue working while keeping things professional.”
If he asks: “What do you mean by personal familiarity?”
Say:
“Comments were made that framed the disagreement in personal terms rather than professional ones, even after I had asked to keep the discussion focused on the work.”
Do not quote exact phrases unless he explicitly asks.
If he asks: “What do you mean by escalation?”
Say:
“When I disagreed with the approach, the response was that it would be taken to you to decide rather than continuing to work through options collaboratively.”
If he asks: “Did you ask to be left out?”
Say:
“Yes. I stated my position and asked to be left out of the discussion, but the topic continued to be raised publicly.”
If he asks: “Did this continue after you disengaged?”
Say:
“Even after I disengaged, the same issue continued to be discussed outside of the immediate work discussion and brought back to me, which reinforced that disengaging alone wasn’t stopping the disruption.”
Stop there.
STEP 3 — If he minimizes or tries to move on too quickly
Use one anchor sentence (pick one):
“My concern isn’t disagreement — it’s how disagreement is being handled.”
or
“I’m less concerned with intent and more concerned with setting clear expectations so this doesn’t continue.”
Then stop.
What you should NOT volunteer unless explicitly asked
Even though it’s true, do not lead with:
exact quotes like “some friend you are”
phrases like “at my expense”
emotional labels (toxic, manipulative, coercive)
speculation about intent
accusations about reputation or motives
Those are supporting details, not headlines.
How to conduct yourself during the conversation
Speak slowly
Say each answer once
Pause after answering
Do not fill silence
Let him ask the next question
Silence works for you, not against you.
Why this playbook is strong
✔ Accurate
✔ Complete
✔ Calm
✔ Non-accusatory
✔ Manager-actionable
You are not complaining.
You are briefing a decision-maker.
Final reassurance
You tried to collaborate.
You set boundaries.
You disengaged only after repetition.
You escalated professionally.
Stick to this script, answer only what’s asked, and stop when the point is made.
If you want help after the conversation — interpreting his response or deciding next steps — I’m here.
