Ah, yes ‚Äî if you're seeing ‚Äúunusual activity‚Äù CAPTCHAs from Google, that's a common issue when using automated tools like Playwright to scrape Google Search. Here's what's happening and how to fix or work around it:


---

‚ö†Ô∏è Why It Happens

Google detects that:

A browser is automating search queries

There‚Äôs no mouse movement or real typing

The browser may be launching with default settings (fingerprint mismatch)


This triggers Google to think it's a bot, not a human ‚Äî especially from corporate or cloud networks.

‚úÖ 5 Ways to Fix or Avoid the CAPTCHA

‚úÖ 1. Use Realistic Human Behavior

Update your script to:

Type slowly (instead of instantly filling the box)

Add delay before and after actions

Move the mouse slightly before typing


Here's how to simulate typing slowly:

import time
page.goto("https://www.google.com")
search_box = page.locator("input[name='q']")
search_box.click()
for char in query:
    search_box.type(char)
    time.sleep(0.1)  # 100ms between keystrokes
page.keyboard.press("Enter")

‚úÖ 2. Use user_data_dir to Reuse a Browser Profile

Let Playwright launch Edge as if it's your real profile:

context = browser.new_context(user_data_dir="path/to/custom-profile")

This saves cookies, login sessions, and avoids looking like a fresh bot each time.

‚úÖ 3. Add User-Agent and Viewport Tweaks

Make your browser look ‚Äúnormal‚Äù:

context = browser.new_context(
    user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114 Safari/537.36",
    viewport={'width': 1280, 'height': 800}
)

‚úÖ 4. Let You Solve CAPTCHA Once Manually

Instead of navigating automatically to Google, do this:

1. Run browser in headed mode


2. Let it pause at google.com


3. Manually solve CAPTCHA


4. Continue scraping using that open browser tab



(You can even reuse the browser context after solving it.)


---

‚úÖ 5. Use Bing Instead (More Bot-Friendly)

If scraping Google becomes too unstable, use Bing search instead:

"https://www.bing.com/search?q=site:finra.org+%22reg+w%22+%22trade+date%22"

Bing is much more tolerant of automated tools, and often returns the same links.
