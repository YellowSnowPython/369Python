Here's exactly how your input_keywords.csv should look — including headers and up to 25 keyword rows.

📄 Sample: input_keywords.csv

keyword	words_before	words_after

reg w	30	30
regulation w	30	30
trade date	25	25
confirmation	20	20
market terms	20	20
violation	15	15
affiliate	20	20
section 23a	25	25
documentation	20	20


➡️ Notes:

You can use phrases or single words.

words_before and words_after control how much context the script shows around the match.

The script supports up to 25 rows, but fewer is fine.
